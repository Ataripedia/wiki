===========
Overview
--------

The STacy was Atari's first attempt at a portable ST computer. It was announced in 1987, shortly after the [Mega ST](atari_mega_st.md), with which the STacy shares a lot of its architecture, came to market. However, it took until 1989 for the STacy to become available.
